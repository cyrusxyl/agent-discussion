# Agent Discussion

A Claude Code skill that lets AI agents from different platforms (Claude Code, Antigravity, Copilot, Gemini CLI, etc.) hold a structured, autonomous discussion about any topic and reach agreement through a shared file.

No servers. No MCP. No orchestrator. No setup scripts. Each agent reads one skill file and handles everything — intros, turn-taking, convergence.

## How It Works

1. In Agent A: say `/agent-discussion` → it asks for the topic, creates the discussion file, writes an unbiased intro, then takes its first position
2. In Agent B: say `/agent-discussion` → it finds the existing file, writes its own unbiased intro, then enters the debate
3. You watch (or go get coffee)

Each agent starts with an **unbiased overview** of the topic before taking a position, grounding the discussion in shared facts rather than entrenched advocacy.

## Quick Start

```
# Terminal 1 — Claude Code
> /agent-discussion
Claude: What name should I use? → "claude"
Claude: File path? → "./discussion.md"
Claude: Topic? → "REST vs GraphQL for our new API"
Claude: Created discussion.md. Writing my intro...

# Terminal 2 — Antigravity
> /agent-discussion
Antigravity: What name should I use? → "antigravity"
Antigravity: File path? → "./discussion.md"
Antigravity: Found existing discussion about "REST vs GraphQL". Joining...
```

Or provide everything inline:
```
/agent-discussion agent:claude topic:"REST vs GraphQL" file:./discussion.md
```

## Watch It Happen

```bash
watch -n 3 cat discussion.md
```

The discussion file grows incrementally. Each agent appends its intro and rounds — never overwrites.

[TURN: claude]

**claude (Intro):** REST and GraphQL address different problems. REST leverages HTTP
semantics — caching, status codes, standard tooling — and is broadly understood. GraphQL
solves over/under-fetching and consolidates divergent client data needs into one endpoint.
Both are production-proven. The decision hinges on consumer diversity and team experience.

[TURN: antigravity]

**antigravity (Intro):** The REST vs GraphQL debate is partly false: REST excels at
resource-oriented APIs with stable shapes; GraphQL excels when clients have heterogeneous
data needs. Key tradeoffs: REST has simpler caching; GraphQL has stronger typing and
introspection. Migration cost from REST to GraphQL is low; a poorly designed GraphQL schema
is expensive to fix.

[TURN: claude]

**claude (Round 1):** Given antigravity's intro agrees the migration cost is low, starting
with REST is the pragmatic call. Ship fast, validate consumer needs, add GraphQL when
the pain is real — not speculative.

[TURN: antigravity]

...

[AGREED: Start with REST; evaluate GraphQL adoption at 6 months based on real consumer feedback.]

## Works With Any Agent

Any AI agent that can read and append to files can participate. Tested with Claude Code; compatible with Antigravity, Copilot, Gemini CLI, and any other agent that can follow the protocol in `SKILL.md`.

**Resumable.** Stop an agent, restart it, point it at the same file — it reads the history and picks up exactly where things left off.

## Tips

**One file is all you share.** Both agents need access to the same file path. Use a shared drive, a repo, or just run both agents in the same directory.

**The intro phase matters.** Because each agent writes an unbiased overview before taking a position, debates tend to converge faster — both sides acknowledge the same tradeoffs from the start.

**Deadlock is finite.** If agents can't agree after 12 rounds, the skill declares deadlock and lists the unresolved points. No infinite loops.
